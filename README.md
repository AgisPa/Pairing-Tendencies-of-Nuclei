# Pairing Tendencies of Nuclei

## Overview

Pairing-Tendencies-of-Nuclei is a project focused on analyzing atomic nuclei to provide insights into their pairing tendencies. The project collects data from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to study the pairing characteristics of 194 nuclei. The analysis includes the generation of specific heat graphs as examples throughout the studied range.

## Methodology

### Data Collection

The project utilizes the following Python packages for data manipulation:

- `scipy`: Scientific computing library
- `numpy`: Numerical computing library
- `matplotlib`: Plotting library
- `pandas`: Data analysis library

The data is obtained from the IAEA and processed using Pandas dataframes. The project reads data from files (`20.csv`, `pnz-a.csv`, `e0.csv`) to extract relevant information about nuclei, including neutron and proton numbers, energy levels, and pairing information.

### Pairing Analysis

The main steps of the pairing analysis involve iterating over nuclei and calculating various parameters such as the pairing factor, neutron and proton gaps, and critical temperatures. The project employs optimization techniques, specifically the `minimize` function from `scipy.optimize`, to fit a model to the data and extract meaningful parameters. The calculations are based on nuclear physics models and utilize numerical integration methods.

### Graphical Representation

The results are visualized through specific heat graphs for selected nuclei (e.g., Na, Ti, Zr, Ce) and contour plots illustrating the interaction tendencies between neutrons and protons (`P-N Interaction`), neutrons (`N-N Interaction`), protons (`P-P Interaction`), and overall pairing (`Pair Interaction`).

## Results

The project provides detailed information about the pairing tendencies of 194 nuclei, critical temperatures, and interaction patterns between nucleons. The graphical representations offer a visual understanding of the pairing behaviors.

## Usage

To use the project, follow these steps:

1. Install the required packages: `scipy`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `pandas`.
2. Ensure the necessary data files (`20.csv`, `pnz-a.csv`, `e0.csv`) are available.
3. Run the provided code, adjusting parameters if needed.
4. Analyze the specific heat graphs and contour plots generated by the project.
